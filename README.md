# OS
Miserably failing at creating an operating system!

# Usage
to run the system, simply (using qemu):

	$ make run

# Dependencies (see Installation...)
- nasm (assembler)
- gcc (C compiler)
- make (build system)
- qemu-system-x86 (machine emulator)

#### Installation (probably requires sudo privileges):

	$ apt install nasm
	$ apt install gcc
	$ apt install make
	$ apt install qemu-system-x86

These packages are common, and should exist in other mainstream package managers (like PacMan, etc.)
